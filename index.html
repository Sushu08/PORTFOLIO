        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong background in both academics and sports. As a district-level cricket player, I have developed discipline, teamwork, and resilienceâ€”qualities that drive me in every aspect of life.

            Currently, I am pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Parul University, where I am honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and C++. My technical journey is fueled by curiosity and a desire to build creative and impactful projects.
            
            Beyond academics and sports, I am an avid gamer, with Free Fire being my go-to game. I enjoy competitive gaming, strategy-building, and improving my skills in the virtual arena.
            
            My ultimate goal is to serve the nation by securing a government job in the Indian Army, Navy, Airforce, or Police. With a blend of physical endurance, strategic thinking, and technical expertise, I am determined to achieve my aspirations.
